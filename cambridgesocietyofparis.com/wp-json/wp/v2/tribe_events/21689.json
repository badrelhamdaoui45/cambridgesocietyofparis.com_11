He has taken two\u00c2\u00a0courses at Prue Leith&#8217;s\u00c2\u00a0School of Food and Wine in London. Last year he got into the last 30 of the BBC junior Bake Off but was told he would be more suitable for the adult competition when he is old enough. He has made a good income for pocket money by cooking full dinners for his parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 friends and neighbours. He is very interested in and knowledgeable about the history of food and recently made for his family a Mince Pie from a 16th century recipe (with real meat).<\/p>\n<p>Aware that lockdown has prevented many of us from going over to the UK for our usual seasonal shopping, we hope this will give you the tricks and tips you need to make your own mince pies to enjoy on Christmas Day.<\/p>\n<p>The demonstration will be shown on Zoom at 4pm on Saturday 5th December. The access link to join will be sent to registered participants a couple of days before the event.<\/p>\n<p>Book now to avoid disappointment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making the perfect mince pie from A to Z &#8211; a tutorial with demonstrations by Sky Quinn Sky, our President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14 year old London-based grandson, is an enthusiastic cook.
