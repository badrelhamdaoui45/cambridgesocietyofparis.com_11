Alan graduated from Bristol University and was, for 30 years, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times. Alan spent two decades covering Latin America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dictatorship, armed rebellions, drug wars and economic meltdown. He was later the newspaper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris bureau chief and European cultural correspondent. He is author of books on Mexico, Shakespeare and Opera and, most recently, of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And The Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-occupied Paris.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He remains a resident of Paris. Andrew and Edward need little introduction to most of our members, Andrew being the current President and Edward a past President of our Society.<\/p>\n<p>TCD have put forward an impressive team, with Edward Donalon, Declan McCavana and their guest speaker David Doyle. David is H.E Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO of St. Kitts and Nevis, while Declan is President of the French Debating Association. Edward is a Barrister and worked for the OECD before becoming an independent consultant in Regulatory Management.<\/p>\n<p>HE Ambassador of Ireland to France Patricia O&#8217;Brien has kindly agreed to host the debate, which will take place at the Irish Embassy, 12 Avenue Foch, 75116 Paris. The Debate will be followed by drinks and the event is expected to conclude at 8:45 pm.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets are now on sale: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 per person for Society members and their guests, with a discounted price of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 per person for members or guests under 30 years of age.
