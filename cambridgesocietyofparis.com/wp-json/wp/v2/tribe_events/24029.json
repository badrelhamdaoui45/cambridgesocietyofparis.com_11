His 1915 shot of \u201cWall Street\u201d extracted the ready-made (yet hidden) symbols of J P Morgan\u2019s bank fa\u00e7ade to reveal parallels with Di Vinci\u2019s\u00a0<em>Last Supper<\/em>\u00a0mural. It suggests the misplaced sanctity of modern financial institutions. Strand\u2019s 1922 article on\u00a0The New Trilogy (making \u201cGod, Christ, and the Holy Ghost\u201d\u00a0into\u00a0\u201cthe machine, materialism and science\u201d) clearly\u00a0criticises the Industrial Age\u2019s worshipping of false gods. His and Charles Sheeler\u2019s chillingly still and vacated views of Henry Ford\u2019s River Rouge automobile plant portray it as a soulless cathedral.<\/p>\n<p>Strand was always there at the cutting edge from Gallery 291 and NYC Dada to documentary filmmaking in LA &amp; Mexico. Banished from the USA during the McCarthy Era, he travelled the world\u2019s political hotspots to finally settle in France compiling photo-book portraits of place. Ever shooting iconic views, his objective, mechanical recording of reality ironically reveals the subjectivity of all human vision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deborah Jenner\u00a0<\/strong>is an American-born art historian; member of College Arts Association.
