Not only was the new king fond of the theatre, which he had enjoyed in France, but after the ban on all theatres imposed by the Puritans in England in 1642, Londoners were keen to rediscover the delights that had been popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean times.<\/p>\n<p>Two theatre companies were set up in Drury Lane and the Haymarket which triggered an immediate flowering of drama from writers such as Dryden, Etherege, Rochester and Wycherley, followed some years later by Congreve, Vanburgh, and George Farquhar. The best plays of the period were comedies, or more precisely satires poking fun at all strata of society. They were written in a combination of wit and sometimes fairly coarse language. The Restoration period also saw the first appearance of women acting female parts, much encouraged by Charles II.<\/p>\n<p>William III, the Dutchman who acceded to the throne in 1689, disapproved of the theatre and this type of comedy eventually disappeared with the Hanoverian succession in 1714.<\/p>\n<p>The Beaux\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Stratagem, first performed in 1707, was Farquhar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last and most successful play. He died a month later aged 30. The play was frequently revived up to 1800, notably by David Garrick, and then disappeared until the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The play hinges on the two beaux\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to travel as master and servant to help them marry into a fortune.<\/p>\n<p>The play is available on the Gutenberg web site free of charge and also easily found 2<sup>nd<\/sup>\u00c2\u00a0hand on various other sites.<\/p>\n<p>Please advise Roger Thorn if you can make it and we look forward to seeing as many of you as can come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roger Thorn<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:roger.thorn@wanadoo.fr\">roger.thorn@wanadoo.fr<\/a><br \/>\nFixed line: 01 34 80 13 33<br \/>\nMobile: 07 86 36 93 58<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oxford play reading on\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday 12th June, from 7pm &#8211; the Restoration comedy,\u00c2\u00a0George Farquhar&#8217;s &#8220;The Beaux&#8217; Strategem&#8221;.
