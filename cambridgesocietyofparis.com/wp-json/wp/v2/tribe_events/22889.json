After graduating he qualified as a solicitor and pursued a legal career in England, in private practice and in industry. After retiring at the end 2011, he and his wife Maddy moved to the Languedoc, France, where they live surrounded by vines, in a landscape not unlike parts of the Western Cape.<\/p>\n<p>Peter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifelong interest in history \u00c2\u00a0drew him to biography.
