It is for new students and all members of the Cambridge Society of Paris. Fascinating for each to meet and for the new students to hear alumni memories of Cambridge. You are highly encouraged to attend.<\/p>\n<p>And what a wonderful bonus, given by the Embassy and Sebastian Faulks, fifty places for members of the Cambridge Society of Paris to attend the launch of Sebastian Faulks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest book, Paris Echo, at the Embassy, the evening of Monday 24<sup>th<\/sup> September. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Paris as you have never seen it before, every building holds an echo of an unacknowledged past, the shadows of Vichy and Algeria.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d This event is a stunner and the (free) tickets will go very fast indeed.<\/p>\n<p>The new Cambridge year brings the start of our two ambitious and important projects: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lectures\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Glory Days of Paris.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The first will be ongoing, two lectures a year, in conjunction with heavyweight Paris based scientific institutions. The second, a cycle of five lectures on the art, literature, jazz, philosophy, and intellectual hedonism of Les Ann\u00c3\u00a9es Folles, an epoque when Paris was at the centre of the artistic world. For the moment, we are keeping the details tantalisingly secret&#8230; except just to say that the first two speakers for the Cutting Edge Lectures are the President of the Royal Society and Professor Sir Roger Penrose. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do better than that!<\/p>\n<p>As a glorious counterpoint, on 23<sup>rd<\/sup> or 24<sup>th<\/sup> November, by way of our Christmas Party, Berlin Cabaret. Exotic, original, opera operetta and Kurt Weil as never before, a stunning dinner performance by the bewigged, bejewelled and bewitching Claudia Roick and Nicole Tschaikin.<\/p>\n<p>Edward Archer is kindly organising his much-loved Christmas Carols at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Paiva, and the Corpus Christi choir will be performing for us in the Spring.<\/p>\n<p>With new committee member David Sayers, we are working on the scope for a photographic exhibition and talk by the wonderfully eccentric American photographer of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s celebrities (including Bianca Jagger on horseback), Rose Hartman.<\/p>\n<p>One of the great successes last year was the guided visit to Christies organised by Val\u00c3\u00a9rie Didier and I am delighted to say that this has been offered again for the current year.<\/p>\n<p>George Young will, we hope, conduct stage two of his walk around the Marais and, in addition, we are planning one or two guided walks around Paris showing Paris as you have never seen it before.<\/p>\n<p>But this is not all, we have some further gems that we hope to reveal ere long, as well as traditional highlights including the Annual Dinner and the Embassy Garden Party.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, as a complete departure, fun for all, young and old, the new craze sweeping Paris and Barcelona: enter into a hidden room in a curious domain. A mystery starts to unfold. You are trapped. You can only escape by using your wits, your skill, your ingenuity. Teams of up to five. I have tried it&#8230; amazing!<\/p>\n<p>Our membership has doubled over the past eighteen months. Very good indeed, and I hope that there are events here that will appeal to all. I look forward enormously to meeting you at as many events as you can manage.<\/p>\n<p>With very best wishes,<\/p>\n<p>Andrew Lyndon-Skeggs<\/p>\n<p>President, Cambridge Society of Paris<\/p>\n<p>12<sup>th<\/sup> September 2018<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new and exciting year \u00c2\u00a0Like the remark before the disastrous wedding speech in Four Weddings and a Funeral \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is something for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Lectures, Welcome Party, Book launch, Dinners, &hellip; <\/p>\n<p class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/2018\/09\/12\/cambridge-society-of-paris-news-bulletin-7\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> &#8220;Cambridge Society of Paris\u00c2\u00a0News Bulletin 7&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":169,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[217,1504769],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/news51-2170469140-1520366984697.jpeg?fit=394%2C145&ssl=1","amp_enabled":true,"ticketed":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2146"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2146"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2146\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2147,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2146\/revisions\/2147"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/169"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2146"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2146"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2146"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
