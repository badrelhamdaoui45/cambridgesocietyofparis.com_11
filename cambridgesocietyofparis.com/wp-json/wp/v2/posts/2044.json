It is wonderful that the Cambridge Society of Paris has grown so much over the last year; your support is hugely appreciated. The more active the Society, the better. The more everyone is involved, the more it will flourish. So, some thoughts:<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Events: first, foremost, and above all, you will be highly welcome at all the events. Any that appeal. The Society is there to be enjoyed<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 New members: From every point of view it is beneficial to increase the membership.

However, some are still floating. If you would like to be the representative for your College, and if the post is still open, you would be more than welcome<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Committee: we currently have a couple of places available on the committee. We are guarding these carefully, but I would be very happy to speak to anyone who might like to put their name forward<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lectures: a long-term programme of top-class lectures on modern topics of burning importance to humanity, to be run in partnership with one or two major Paris based institutions.

Your input, and ideas for inspiring speakers, would be most welcome.<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Venues: every event requires a venue.
