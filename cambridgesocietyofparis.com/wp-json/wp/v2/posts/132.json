An excellent step in the right direction, but the intent is to go much further, to double the membership over the next year to eighteen months!<\/p>\n<p>Members of the committee have started work on this, and initiatives have been launched, including direct liaison with undergraduates at the University, and representatives for every College.<\/p>\n<p>A new undergraduate, Esha Marwaha (Gonville &amp; Caius), has stepped forward and will be running a stand for us at the Freshers Fair and is in the process of establishing undergraduate representatives for each College who will liaise with our Alumni College representatives here in Paris.<\/p>\n<p>Already ten Alumni College Representatives have been identified, and Magdalene has asked for an article about the Cambridge Society, and the fabulous Christmas Party, for the November edition of Magdalene Matters.<\/p>\n<p>Alumni College Representatives so far include: Christ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Emmanuel, Fitzwilliam, Jesus, King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Magdalene, Murray Edwards, Newnham, St John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Trinity. Once this gets underway it will be an important motor for new membership and for liaison at all levels with the University. If your College is not already represented, and if you would be good enough to take on the role, this would be highly appreciated. Please contact myself (anls@lyndon-skeggs.com) or Tony Banton (admin@camsocparis.org).<\/p>\n<p>Doubtless you have seen the recent events reminder sent out by Tony, and I think you will agree .. not bad! Some outstanding new events including the Christmas Party, the Union Challenge Debate and the Fingask Follies Musical Review, in addition to a wide range of traditional activities.<\/p>\n<p>So, much work in hand. What can you do? A lot please! If your College is not so far covered, and you would like to be the official representative, then do please make contact. Medium term we shall be looking for two new committee members. If you would like to assist in this way, it would be wonderful.<\/p>\n<p>But above all, we really want to see you at the forthcoming events. Do please join in whenever you can; you will be highly welcome. The more this society, or club, is attended, the more fun it will be, and the better we can benefit the University.<\/p>\n<p>For the big events in the near future, yes definitely please, and bring your family and friends. But likewise, though fifty maximum, please keep in mind the dinner debate coming up on Thursday 12th October, championing the merits, or denouncing the demerits of modern technology. This is taking place at a super new venue, totally private to us, the 5e Cru wine bar at 7 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine, metro Cardinal Lemoine (10) or Jussieu (7). It is atmospheric, specialises in unusual wines, good food at incredible value .. and a debate as well!<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward to seeing you.<\/p>\n<p>With very best wishes,<\/p>\n<p>Andrew.<br \/>\nPresident Cambridge Society of Paris.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Member The first committee meeting since the rentr\u00c3\u00a9e, and the roll out of our plans for membership and mega new events.
