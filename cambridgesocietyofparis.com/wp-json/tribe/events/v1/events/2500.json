Attendees have been encouraged to join the Society &#8211; free membership being offered to all current students &#8211; and there are now over 70 such members in the Society. This has led to a joint initiative, together with the French Society in Cambridge to organise a cheese and wine evening in Cambridge. The aim is to allow those members in residence there and their friends to get together, naturally with a French theme as cheeses will be brought over from France specially for the event, and you will be able to enjoy them with wines provided by Cambridge Wine Merchants in good company.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets are \u00c2\u00a38 each and can be obtained on line through the following link &#8211; Getqpay registration form &#8211; there are still about half-a-dozen left.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"fri-1st-february-2019-cheese-and-wine-in-cambridge","image":{"url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?fit=600%2C275&ssl=1","id":2501,"extension":"jpeg","width":600,"height":275,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?fit=150%2C150&ssl=1"},"medium":{"width":300,"height":138,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?fit=300%2C138&ssl=1"},"twentyseventeen-thumbnail-avatar":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1"},"woocommerce_thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":275,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","uncropped":false,"url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?resize=250%2C275&ssl=1"},"woocommerce_single":{"width":350,"height":160,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?fit=350%2C160&ssl=1"},"woocommerce_gallery_thumbnail":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1"},"shop_catalog":{"width":250,"height":275,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?resize=250%2C275&ssl=1"},"shop_single":{"width":350,"height":160,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?fit=350%2C160&ssl=1"},"shop_thumbnail":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese.jpeg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1"},"sow-carousel-default":{"width":272,"height":182,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/wine-and-cheese-272x182.jpeg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2019-02-01 19:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"01","hour":"19","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-02-01 21:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"01","hour":"21","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2019-02-01 18:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"01","hour":"18","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-02-01 20:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"01","hour":"20","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"Europe\/Paris","timezone_abbr":"CET","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":false,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Event","slug":"event","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":24,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":58,"filter":"raw","id":606770204,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/606770204","collection":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":[],"organizer":[{"id":2503,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2018-11-14 21:54:21","date_utc":"2018-11-14 20:54:21","modified":"2018-11-14 21:54:21","modified_utc":"2018-11-14 20:54:21","url":"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/organiser\/university-of-cambridge\/","organizer":"University of Cambridge","slug":"university-of-cambridge","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"University of Cambridge","description":"","url":"","telephone":"","email":"","sameAs":""},"global_id":"cambridgesocietyofparis.com?id=2503","global_id_lineage":["cambridgesocietyofparis.com?id=2503"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Cheese and Wine in Cambridge","description":"&lt;p&gt;Fri 1st\u00c2\u00a0February 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Cheese and Wine in Cambridge You are invited to the Cambridge Society of Paris event in Cambridge on Friday 1st February at 7pm at the University &hellip;
