Finance has now become so entangled with our daily existence that theoretical and philosophical considerations of financialization have declared the emergence of a new subject, starting with Michel Foucault\u2019s entrepreneur of the self.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, a number of subjects have been added to the list: Randy Martin\u2019s <em>financialized self<\/em>, Paul Langley\u2019s Foucauldian <em>uncertain subject<\/em>, Maurizio Lazzarato\u2019s <em>indebted man<\/em>, Rob Aitken\u2019s bodies that are turned into objects for financial income, Michel Feher\u2019s <em>rated agents<\/em>, and most recently Aris Komporozos-Athanasiou\u2019s <em>homo speculans<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas these accounts remain primarily Foucauldian and Deleuzian, Solange will argue that the new milieu that finance gives rise to is also the background from which Stiegler\u2019s, Malabou\u2019s, and Lordon\u2019s ontologies have developed, thereby offering theoretical tools that are more appropriate to our times.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24366\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Solange-Photo-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C203&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"203\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Solange Manche is a PhD candidate in French, working on the thought of Bernard Stiegler, Catherine Malabou, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lordon.
