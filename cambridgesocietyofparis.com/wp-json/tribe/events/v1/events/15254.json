His first book, Louis XVIII, published in 1981, together with his subsequent works, such as The Court of France 1789-1830 and Paris Between Empires 1814-1852, established him as an authority on the French Monarchy during its Restoration after the French Revolution and the July Monarchy.<\/p>\n<p>In 1995, Philip Mansel founded the Society for Court Studies, together with David Starkey and others. He has also published books related to the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. He has contributed numerous reviews and articles to well-known newspapers and journals and received many awards and decorations.<\/p>\n<p>It may seem surprising, but despite the wealth of historical writing devoted to the period, Philip Mansel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biography, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<em>King of the World: The Life of Louis XIV<\/em>\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, published in July of this year [<a href=\"#m_-6195241869616261805__ftn1\"><strong><sup>*<\/sup><\/strong><\/a>], is by far the most comprehensive and up-to-date biography of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Sun King\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Going far beyond an account of the public events of the reign which are perhaps better-known, Philip Mansel explores the monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contradictions and his inner life, and presents a masterly depiction of the internal workings of his Court. He has achieved the feat of producing a biography which is both impeccably scholarly and immensely readable!<\/p>\n<p>The dinner will be held in the splendid <em>Salon Pourpre <\/em>dining room of the Senate.<\/p>\n<p><u>Prices<\/u>, which include an aperitif and a 3-course dinner with wine and coffee, are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>members of OUSP, OBA and CamSoc + 1 guest: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65 per person<\/li>\n<li>junior members &lt;30 years old and current students + 1 guest: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac49 pp<\/li>\n<li>non-member alumni + additional guests: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75 pp<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><u>Payment<\/u> can be made<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>either<\/em> by cheque made out to OUSP,<\/li>\n<li>\u00c2\u00a0<em>or<\/em>\u00c2\u00a0by bank transfer (details in attached Registration form).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you wish to join us for the dinner, please complete and return the attached <a href=\"https:\/\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/registration-form-for-ousp-dinner-16-11-2019\/\"><u>Registration form<\/u><\/a> as soon as possible and in any event for <strong>receipt by no later than Monday, 4<sup>th<\/sup> November, 2019<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As we are unable to increase the number of places reserved at the venue, we recommend early registration to avoid disappointment.
