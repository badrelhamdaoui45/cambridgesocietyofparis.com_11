We are honoured and delighted.<\/p>\n<p>This first event will be a reading by Sir Michael Edwards of poems from his latest publication: At the Brasserie Lipp. Following the poetry reading, there will be a reception with drinks and light snacks, accompanied by piano music played no one of the magnificent grand pianos at the American Cathedral.<\/p>\n<p>As well as the event itself, for anyone who does not already know the American Cathedral, this will be a revelation and joy, being one of the finest examples of English Gothic Revival architecture in Europe, founded by Dr John Brainerd Morgan, cousin of J.P. Morgan.<\/p>\n<p>Sir Michael Edwards, Honorary Fellow of Christ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College, Cambridge, is very well known as being the first Englishman ever to have been elected to the Coll\u00c3\u00a8ge de France (2002) and to one of the 40 seats of the Acad\u00c3\u00a9mie Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise (2013). Following his reading, Sir Michael will make available signed copies of his book, At the Brasserie Lipp.<\/p>\n<p>In the spirit of the occasion, this event is entirely <strong>free of charge<\/strong>, though there will be a voluntary collection, to be donated to the cathedral and to cover the costs of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>You are very warmly invited to this inaugural and delightful event.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew
