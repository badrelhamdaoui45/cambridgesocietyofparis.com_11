Opportunities and Challenges","description":"<p>The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement was hailed as the resolution to the long-running negotiations between Britain and the EU just before Christmas. But how should my business be using it? Is it as effective as businesses would like in the key areas that affect them? How can my business seize any opportunities?<\/p>\n<p>These questions and many more are at the front of our minds as everyone tries to work out what the Agreement really means.<\/p>\n<p>We are delighted to welcome two eminent experts in the field to a Forum on how business can deal with the Agreement, Catherine Barnard from Cambridge University and Paul Taylor from the Department for International Trade at the British Embassy in Paris. They will cover the key aspects of the Agreement, but above all we hope to cover those issues your business is facing and answer your questions. When you register, you will be invited to let us know what topics interest you and what your questions are. There will also be the opportunity to ask your questions during the Forum.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Catherine Barnard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-22205\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?resize=215%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?resize=215%2C300&amp;ssl=1 215w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?resize=734%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 734w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?resize=108%2C150&amp;ssl=1 108w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?resize=768%2C1072&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?resize=350%2C488&amp;ssl=1 350w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/cambridgesocietyofparis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/C-Barnard-happier-picture.png?w=1075&amp;ssl=1 1075w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Catherine Barnard is Professor of EU law and Employment Law and senior tutor and fellow of Trinity College.\u00c2\u00a0 She is the author of EU Employment Law (Oxford, OUP, 2012, 5th ed.), The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms, (Oxford, OUP, 2016, 5th ed), and (with Peers ed), European Union Law (Oxford, OUP, 2017, 2nd ed) .
