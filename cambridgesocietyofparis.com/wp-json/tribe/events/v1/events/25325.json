For all organisations \u2013 large and small, public and private \u2013 innovation drives growth and productivity.\u00a0 For nations, innovation is a key driver of improvements to quality of life, and underpins vibrant and resilient economies and communities.\u00a0 Innovation is clearly something really important for all of us. However, it is incredibly hard to do well, and getting it wrong can have huge consequences. This talk will explore some of the issues on why innovation is so hard to get right, and what organisations and nations can do to improve the chances of success.<\/p>\n<p>The lecture will take place on Tuesday 13th June from 7pm to 8pm and will be hosted on GoogleMeet.\u00a0 There is no charge for this event.
