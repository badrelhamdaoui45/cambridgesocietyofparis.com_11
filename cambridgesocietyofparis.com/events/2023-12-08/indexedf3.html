SUMMARY:We are pleased to circulate an Invitation from our friends at the ESU
DESCRIPTION:www.esuparis.fr \nDear Friends\, \nWe are pleased to announce that the visit to the Plans reliefs which had been postponed \nwill take place on \nFriday 8 December 2023 at 10.30 am \nWe will have a private guided visit with the Curator of the Musee of the \nPLANS RELIEFS – the FORTS of the ALPS \nHôtel National des Invalides \n129 rue de Grenelle 75007 Paris \nThe exhibition reflects on more than 350 years of the history of the fortified cities which \nwere to protect the kingdom of France against unpredictable invasions from Italy or other \nEuropean countries. The frontier has been a complex notion since Louis XIV and is part of \nthe national identity. \nWe will see Mont Dauphin which is in France and was built by Vauban in 1693 and \nFenestrelle built in 1728 by the King of Sardinia\, the longest wall in Europe vying with the \nGreat Wall of China. \nThe number of visitors is limited so please could you send your reply straight away to \nLuce Loussouarn : ljloussouarn@free.fr \nWe will meet in the courtyard at 10.15 am. \nLooking forward to seeing you again. Best wishes\, \nLuce Loussouarn \nPresident ESU Paris \n________________________________________________________________________________ \nParticipation 10€ per person to be paid: \n? by cheque made out to the order of the English Speaking Union Paris and sent to Luce \nLoussouarn \nor \n? by bank transfer to ESU Paris’s bank account at the Credit Industriel et Commercial \nIBAN: FR76 3006 6105 8100 0201 6150 183 BIC: CMCIFRPP \nPlease record “ESU visit Plans reliefs” in the reference box with your surname. \nThis form must be sent to: Luce Loussouarn\, 8 Villa de Ségur\, 75007 Paris Email:ljloussouarn@free.fr
