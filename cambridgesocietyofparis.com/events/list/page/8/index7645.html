SUMMARY:Freshers' Welcome Drinks
DESCRIPTION:Each year\, CamSoc takes part in the Universityâ€™s world-wide program of events for those students who have recently been successful in gaining a place at Cambridge\, whether as an Undergraduate or a Graduate. \nThe aim is to give them an opportunity to meet other new students coming from France and to chat to members about their experience in Cambridge so they are better prepared on arrival in their College at the end of the month. \nWe have again booked the upstairs room of the Frog Revolution\, 9 rue de la Bastille (metro Bastille) with drinks and snacks provided. \nThere will be a charge of â‚¬20 per person for members\, although admission is free for all current students of the University whether members of CamSoc or not and\, of course\, the Freshers.

SUMMARY:Dordogne Cambridge Society Summer Visit
DESCRIPTION:Join the Dordogne Cambridge Group for their upcoming visit to the Cloisters of Cadouin. \nThis is a break with tradition: dwhen our group began\, most people lived in this part of the Dordogne and had already seen the main places of interest in the area\, so those places were not usually chosen for group outings\, but some conversations last summer made me realise that so many of us live in other parts of the region that many members have never visited the Dordogne sites. \nSo this is a chance to see one of the most beautiful of them all\, which draws people from all over the world. Even if you have been there before\, you will definitely not be bored: the opulence of the carving is incredible. \nA bonus is that our tour will be followed by lunch at much-appreciatedÂ Restaurant de lâ€™Abbaye which is just across the road. \nMore info on this too will follow soon\, so we can make the necessary reservations in good time.

SUMMARY:Glory Days of Paris - Guided Tour of the Destribats Collection

Christie’s has agreed to give us a private guided tourÂ of the outstanding Destribats collection\, at Christie’s Paris\, at 9am on Tuesday 2nd July. \nThe Books Department of Christie’s\, in partnership with experts Jean-Baptiste de Proyart and Claude Oterelo\, are arranging the sale of the Avant-Garde Library collected by Paul Destribats (1926-2017). \nThis exceptional jewel of books and manuscripts has been kept jealously for sixty years – only a limited number of researchers and a few friends have had access. The Avant-Garde Library comprises 6\,000 books\, leaflets and manifestos from the 20th Century. The first three sales will include more than 600 titles spanning from 1910 to 1945 including many works by members of the Dada and Surrealism movements in Paris. The sales will take place on 3rd\, 4th and 5th July in Christie’s Paris.Â A fuller description\, in French\, can be downloaded here. \nThis really is a special opportunity to see these works that have been kept secret for so long and you can attend the guided tour whether or not you come to the lecture on Friday 28th June.

SUMMARY:Oxford and Cambridge Talk : The Menace of Monolinguism
DESCRIPTION:Thurs 28th March – Oxford and Cambridge Talk :Â The Menace of Monolinguism \nIs Monolingualism harming us? Does the study of language benefit the individual and society? Can multilingualism contribute towards our health and well-being\, social cohesion and diplomacy? \nWho better to answer these questions than Wendy Ayers-Bennett\, Professor of French Philology and Linguistics at the University of Cambridge and Professorial Fellow in Linguistics at Murray Edwards College\, Cambridge. \nWendy Ayres-Bennett obtained her BA and MA studying Modern Languages\, French and German\, at Girton College\, Cambridge and has since specialised in the evolution and history of the French language and the history of linguistic thought. She has had six posts as a Visiting Professor in France and is a Principal Investigator on the MEITS project\, Â Multilingualism; Empowering Individuals\, Transforming Societies. Her books include a History of the French Language and Problems and Perspectives; Studies in the Modern French Language. \nThe lecture is taking place atÂ 18 rue BonaparteÂ where we are the guests of the Czech Cultural Centre. This property has close ties to the history of Czechoslovakia\, having been used by a number of Czech organisations\, including the Sokol movement\, and was the base from which Edward Benes\, future President of Czechoslovakia\, with T.G. Masaryk and M.R. Stefanik organised a Czecho-Slovak army to fight for the Western Allies in France. \n

SUMMARY:The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture: Gene Machine
DESCRIPTION:Thurs 7th March 2019 â€“ The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture: Â Gene Machine\nThe race for the structure of the ribosome â€” a study in the sociology of science\nEveryone has heard of DNA â€” the molecule that seems to hold the secrets of all life\, but hardly anyone has heard of the ribosome. While DNA is the blueprint for life it rests inertly within our cells. The ribosome is an enormous molecular machine\, even more ancient than DNA that translates the information in our genes into proteins. These proteins in turn make up much of our bodies and catalyse thousands of processes within our cells. \nA ribosome is a machine no cell can do without\, but until recently\, how this machine worked was a mystery. As well as being essential for life\, its practical importance also lies in the fact that the ribosome is the target of many major antibiotics. A knowledge of the structure of the ribosome is the key to the development of new treatments against deadly infections\, so crucial for the future of mankind. \nIn his lecture Venki Ramakrishnan will outline the extraordinary race between groups of scientists around the world to be the first to uncover the structure of this central element of the human body. It is a story of high science\, rivalry\, generosity and mutual support. In other words it is a story of humanity uncovering one of the secrets of humanity! \nHe will also talk about what he calls the Politics of Recognition in science. It is a well-known adage that the essential first step to a Nobel Prize is to work in a lab where there are already Nobel Laureates â€” is this true and\, if so\, what does this mean? There have been 12 Nobel Prizes for staff of his own lab since it opened in 1958\, as well as 11 for scientists who have spent time there as visitors. \nVenki is group leader at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. In 2009 he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on ribosomal structure and was knighted in 2012. He is a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences\, Leopoldina and EMBO\, and a Foreign Member of the Indian National Science Academy. In 2015\, he was elected as President of the Royal Society for a five-year term.
