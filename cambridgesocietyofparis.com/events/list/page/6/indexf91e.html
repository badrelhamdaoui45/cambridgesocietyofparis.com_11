SUMMARY:Oxford and Cambridge Paris Poetry and Prose Reading
DESCRIPTION:Developing the theme of the Play Readings that were organised for the enjoyment of members of both the Oxford and Cambridge Societies in Paris\, we have organised a Poetry or Prose reading evening\, on Wednesday 6th January 2021 at 7pm. \nThis date has been chosen both as it coincides with the First Wednesday in 2021\, and so we hope will help compensate for the continued absence of Monthly Drinks evenings\, and also it is Epiphany which might offer a theme\, if you choose to adopt it\, for your reading. \nThe Cambridge Society has kindly agreed to lead the event\, which will be hosted on Zoom.Â  A meeting link will be sent to all registered attendees two or three days before of the event. \nEach participant will be invited to select their choice of readings\, in English\, ideally each up to three minutes long. For the more adventurous\, you can of course write your own. We expect you will have the opportunity of reading at least twice.

SUMMARY:Christmas Baking - Making the perfect mince pie from A to Z
DESCRIPTION:Making the perfect mince pie from A to Z – a tutorial with demonstrations by Sky Quinn \nSky\, our Presidentâ€™s 14 year old London-based grandson\, is an enthusiastic cook. He has taken twoÂ courses at Prue Leith’sÂ School of Food and Wine in London. Last year he got into the last 30 of the BBC junior Bake Off but was told he would be more suitable for the adult competition when he is old enough. He has made a good income for pocket money by cooking full dinners for his parentsâ€™ friends and neighbours. He is very interested in and knowledgeable about the history of food and recently made for his family a Mince Pie from a 16th century recipe (with real meat). \nAware that lockdown has prevented many of us from going over to the UK for our usual seasonal shopping\, we hope this will give you the tricks and tips you need to make your own mince pies to enjoy on Christmas Day. \nThe demonstration will be shown on Zoom at 4pm on Saturday 5th December. The access link to join will be sent to registered participants a couple of days before the event. \nBook now to avoid disappointment.

SUMMARY:Oxford Society Dinner on Saturday 16th November
DESCRIPTION:All places available for this event have now been allocated. You may apply to be put on the waiting list\, but a place will only be allocated if there are cancellations. \nThe President and Committee of the Oxford University Society in Paris are pleased to invite you to a dinner at which our speaker will be Dr. Philip Mansel\, FRHistS\, Chevalier de lâ€™Ordre des Arts et Lettres\, who will give us an illustrated talk on \nÂ â€œLouis XIV and the English: from Francophobia to Francophiliaâ€ \nDate :Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Saturday\, 16th November 2019YouÂ  \nTime :Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  6.00 for 6.30 pm apÃ©ritif\, 7.00 pm dinner* \nVenue : Â Â Â  Â  Le SÃ©nat\, Palais du Luxembourg\,Â  15 ter rue de Vaugirard\, 75006 Paris \nDress :Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Lounge suits \n*N.B. Please note that the Senate will close its doors at 7.00 pm and that no admission will be possible after that time. So\, if you will be attending the dinner\, please make sure you arrive WELL BEFORE 7.00 pm. \nBookings are managed by the Oxford Society. Please use their registration form to reserve your places. \nPhilip Mansel read Modern History and Modern Languages at Balliol (1970) and received his doctorate on the French Court under the Restoration Monarchy from UCL. His first book\, Louis XVIII\, published in 1981\, together with his subsequent works\, such as The Court of France 1789-1830 and Paris Between Empires 1814-1852\, established him as an authority on the French Monarchy during its Restoration after the French Revolution and the July Monarchy. \nIn 1995\, Philip Mansel founded the Society for Court Studies\, together with David Starkey and others. He has also published books related to the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. He has contributed numerous reviews and articles to well-known newspapers and journals and received many awards and decorations. \nIt may seem surprising\, but despite the wealth of historical writing devoted to the period\, Philip Manselâ€™s biography\, â€œKing of the World: The Life of Louis XIVâ€\, published in July of this year [*]\, is by far the most comprehensive and up-to-date biography of â€œthe Sun Kingâ€. Going far beyond an account of the public events of the reign which are perhaps better-known\, Philip Mansel explores the monarchâ€™s contradictions and his inner life\, and presents a masterly depiction of the internal workings of his Court. He has achieved the feat of producing a biography which is both impeccably scholarly and immensely readable! \nThe dinner will be held in the splendid Salon Pourpre dining room of the Senate. \nPrices\, which include an aperitif and a 3-course dinner with wine and coffee\, are: \n\nmembers of OUSP\, OBA and CamSoc + 1 guest: â‚¬65 per person\njunior members <30 years old and current students + 1 guest: â‚¬49 pp\nnon-member alumni + additional guests: â‚¬75 pp\n\nPayment can be made \n\neither by cheque made out to OUSP\,\nÂ orÂ by bank transfer (details in attached Registration form).\n\nIf you wish to join us for the dinner\, please complete and return the attached Registration form as soon as possible and in any event for receipt by no later than Monday\, 4th November\, 2019. \nAs we are unable to increase the number of places reserved at the venue\, we recommend early registration to avoid disappointment. Registrations will be treated on a â€˜first come\, first servedâ€™ basis and will be individually confirmed. \nMembers must provide their full names and those of their guests to be communicated to the Senate beforehand and photographic identity documents may be required for access to it on the evening. \nWe look forward to seeing you at the dinner. \nBest wishes\, \nCarol Amouyel Kent \nPresident Oxford Society of Paris \n[*] A number of copies will be available for sale at a discount.

SUMMARY:The second Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture:Â Professor Sir Roger Penrose
DESCRIPTION:BOOKING NOW OPEN \nSECOND CAMBRIDGE CUTTING EDGE LECTURE  \nPROFESSOR SIR ROGER PENROSEÂ   \nâ€œHAWKING POINTS IN THE COSMIC MICROWAVE SKYâ€  \n12 noon Wednesday 23rd October 2019  \nConservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers \n 292 Rue Saint-Martin\, 75003 Paris \nMÃ©tro Arts et MÃ©tiers (lines 3 or 11) or RÃ©aumur-SÃ©bastapol (lines 3 or 4) \nFollowing the resounding success of the first Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture delivered by Sir Venki Ramakrishnan at the Institut Pasteur\, we are immensely lucky to have another scientist of world renown for the second lecture\, Professor Sir Roger Penrose\, and to have been permitted most generously by the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers to hold this lecture in their beautiful\, historic amphitheatre AbbÃ© GrÃ©goire. This event is very highly recommended. \nSir Roger Penrose OM FRS is an English mathematical physicist. He studied at University College London and at St Johnâ€™s College Cambridge and is now the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of mathematics at Oxford. \nThe son of a psychiatrist and geneticist\, grandson of a physiologist\, brother of a physicist and of a chess grandmaster\, Roger Penrose has won numerous prizes and awards and is one of the most important living scientists in the world. He worked closely with Stephen Hawking and appeared in the film\, a Brief History of Time. \nThe work undertaken by Roger Penrose has been wide ranging and of immense importance. Taking but two examples: in 1964 he revolutionised the mathematical tools used to analyse the properties of space time and\, later\, his epoch-making paper â€œGravitational collapse and space time singularitiesâ€ lead to the cosmology of Big Bang and Black Holes which he worked on with Stephen Hawking. \nIn lighter vein\, Roger Penrose also devised the Penrose Triangle which he described as â€œimpossibility in its purest formâ€ which he conveyed to the artist M.C. Escher. \nThe topic of Professor Penroseâ€™s Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture is â€œHawking Points in the Cosmic Microwave Skyâ€ in which he will reveal his theories of cosmology and his scientific belief that our Universe is in fact just one of a series of Universes\, or eons\, each commencing with a Big Bang that had its origins in the dim distant past of a preceding Universe. \nHaving attended one of Roger Penroseâ€™s lectures in London\, I can only say that it was utterly astounding. Deep\, cutting edge\, completely incomprehensible science delivered in a way that was\, anyway superficially\, understandable by all\, holding the audience enthralled. By the end\, my head was spinning with ideas and revelations beyond my wildest expectations. \nOver and above\, there will be the delight of seeing the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers and the beautiful historic amphitheatre AbbÃ© GrÃ©goire\, built in the 1840s\, named after the founder of the Conservatoire\, an important political figure during the French Revolution depicted in Davidâ€™s famous painting The Serment du Jeu de Paume. \nThis lecture by Professor Sir Roger Penrose will probably be a one-off ever and a landmark experience for many. It is definitely not to be missed. \nAndrew Lyndon-Skeggs\nPresident\nCambridge Society of Paris

SUMMARY:Challenge Debate against Trinity College Dublin
DESCRIPTION:Thursday 10th October at 7 pm – Challenge Debate against Trinity College Dublin\nBooking has now closed for this event \nTHIS HOUSE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST IS YET TO COME \nIn similar fashion to our challenge to the Cambridge Union\, two years ago\, the Cambridge Society of Paris has challenged Trinity College Dublin to a debateÂ  and we will be speaking in favour of the motion that the best is yet to come. \nOur speakers\, Andrew Lyndon-Skeggs and Edward Archer\, will be joined by Alan Riding as guest speaker. Alan graduated from Bristol University and was\, for 30 years\, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times. Alan spent two decades covering Latin Americaâ€™s dictatorship\, armed rebellions\, drug wars and economic meltdown. He was later the newspaperâ€™s Paris bureau chief and European cultural correspondent. He is author of books on Mexico\, Shakespeare and Opera and\, most recently\, of â€œAnd The Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-occupied Paris.â€ He remains a resident of Paris. Andrew and Edward need little introduction to most of our members\, Andrew being the current President and Edward a past President of our Society. \nTCD have put forward an impressive team\, with Edward Donalon\, Declan McCavana and their guest speaker David Doyle. David is H.E Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO of St. Kitts and Nevis\, while Declan is President of the French Debating Association. Edward is a Barrister and worked for the OECD before becoming an independent consultant in Regulatory Management. \nHE Ambassador of Ireland to France Patricia O’Brien has kindly agreed to host the debate\, which will take place at the Irish Embassy\, 12 Avenue Foch\, 75116 Paris. The Debate will be followed by drinks and the event is expected to conclude at 8:45 pm. \nTickets are now on sale: â‚¬20 per person for Society members and their guests\, with a discounted price of â‚¬10 per person for members or guests under 30 years of age. Early booking is recommended as we anticipate that demand may exceed the number of places that have been allocated to us. For members who are not able to book their place through the website\, a PDF booking form can be obtained by contacting Tony Banton on admin@camsocparis.org. \nUnless all tickets are sold before\, the final date for booking your place is Sunday 6th October\, as the list of participants then has to be provided to the Embassy’s security staff. \nAs the debate takes place in the Irish Embassy\, members and guests must bring photographic ID in order to be admitted to the event. \n

SUMMARY:Dordogne Cambridge Society Summer Visit
DESCRIPTION:Join the Dordogne Cambridge Group for their upcoming visit to the Cloisters of Cadouin. \nThis is a break with tradition: dwhen our group began\, most people lived in this part of the Dordogne and had already seen the main places of interest in the area\, so those places were not usually chosen for group outings\, but some conversations last summer made me realise that so many of us live in other parts of the region that many members have never visited the Dordogne sites. \nSo this is a chance to see one of the most beautiful of them all\, which draws people from all over the world. Even if you have been there before\, you will definitely not be bored: the opulence of the carving is incredible. \nA bonus is that our tour will be followed by lunch at much-appreciatedÂ Restaurant de lâ€™Abbaye which is just across the road. \nMore info on this too will follow soon\, so we can make the necessary reservations in good time.

SUMMARY:Glory Days of Paris - Guided Tour of the Destribats Collection
DESCRIPTION:We are delighted to announce thatÂ an event has been added related to the second Glory Days of Paris lecture\, on Dadaism and Surrealism. Christie’s has agreed to give us a private guided tourÂ of the outstanding Destribats collection\, at Christie’s Paris\, at 9am on Tuesday 2nd July. \nThe Books Department of Christie’s\, in partnership with experts Jean-Baptiste de Proyart and Claude Oterelo\, are arranging the sale of the Avant-Garde Library collected by Paul Destribats (1926-2017). \nThis exceptional jewel of books and manuscripts has been kept jealously for sixty years – only a limited number of researchers and a few friends have had access. The Avant-Garde Library comprises 6\,000 books\, leaflets and manifestos from the 20th Century. The first three sales will include more than 600 titles spanning from 1910 to 1945 including many works by members of the Dada and Surrealism movements in Paris. The sales will take place on 3rd\, 4th and 5th July in Christie’s Paris.Â A fuller description\, in French\, can be downloaded here. \nThis really is a special opportunity to see these works that have been kept secret for so long and you can attend the guided tour whether or not you come to the lecture on Friday 28th June.

SUMMARY:Glory Days of Paris lecture: The philosophical framework\, Dadaism and Surrealism
DESCRIPTION:Glory Days of Paris is a series of six lectures delivered over two years\, 2019 and 2020\, focusing on the Parisian literary and artistic world of the 1920s and â€˜30s\, with an introductory lecture to precede this period and a concluding lecture set in the â€˜50s and â€˜60s.
