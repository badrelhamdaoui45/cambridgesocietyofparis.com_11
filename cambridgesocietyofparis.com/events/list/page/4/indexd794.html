SUMMARY:PADFAS - Zoom Lecture on Paul Strand
DESCRIPTION:PADFAS (The Arts Society Paris) invites members of the Cambridge Society of Paris to join their Live online Zoom lecture on Thursday 17th February\, 2022 at 14.00. \nDeborah Jenner will present Paul Strand’s “Straight Photography”.\n \nPaul Strand’s sharply focused Straight Photography elevated this Machine Age tool – a camera – to a medium of Fine Art through exquisitely composed images in highly contrasted tones of black and white. His 1915 shot of “Wall Street” extracted the ready-made (yet hidden) symbols of J P Morgan’s bank façade to reveal parallels with Di Vinci’s Last Supper mural. It suggests the misplaced sanctity of modern financial institutions. Strand’s 1922 article on The New Trilogy (making “God\, Christ\, and the Holy Ghost” into “the machine\, materialism and science”) clearly criticises the Industrial Age’s worshipping of false gods. His and Charles Sheeler’s chillingly still and vacated views of Henry Ford’s River Rouge automobile plant portray it as a soulless cathedral. \nStrand was always there at the cutting edge from Gallery 291 and NYC Dada to documentary filmmaking in LA & Mexico. Banished from the USA during the McCarthy Era\, he travelled the world’s political hotspots to finally settle in France compiling photo-book portraits of place. Ever shooting iconic views\, his objective\, mechanical recording of reality ironically reveals the subjectivity of all human vision. \nDeborah Jenner is an American-born art historian; member of College Arts Association. Residing in Paris since 1990\, she has worked at the Ecole du Louvre\, the Sorbonne\, the Catholic Institute and the British Council. Her Doctorate thesis proved non-western influences in Georgia O’Keeffe’s art. Her publications include catalogue essays for Musée d’Orsay (New York City et l’Art modern) and Centre Pompidou (Les Traces du Sacré)\, scholarly papers with the research laboratory S.A.R.I. and Gallery critiques in ArtAsiaPacific\, and PerformArts: Artvisuel-Artvivant. She gives public talks\, guided walks and museum tours for ex-pat organisations and study-abroad programs and volunteers as an Al Gore Climate leader and JCF Round Table coordinator. She is a member of The Arts Society Paris. \nPlease book your free place directly with PADFAS by using this link.

SUMMARY:Paris Freshers Welcome Drinks
DESCRIPTION:The Cambridge Society of Paris is again taking part in the Universityâ€™s world-wide program of events for those students who have recently been successful in gaining a place at Cambridge\, whether as an Undergraduate or a Graduate. \nThe aim is to give them an opportunity to meet other new students coming from France and to chat to members about their experience in Cambridge so they are better prepared on arrival in their College at the start of their first term. \nThis year we have found an outdoor venue\, at the Fondation Goodplanet\, which we hope will be conducive to the current rules relating to social distancing. The venue is in the Bois de Boulogne and for those without a car\, there are three buses running about every 10-15 minutes: \n\nline 43\, which has a stop at Pont de Neuilly (metro line 1) and goes to Longchamp-Goodplanet\nline 241\, which leaves from Porte d’Auteuil (metro line 10) and goes to Les Moulins-Camping\nline 244\, which stops at Porte Maillot (metro line 1 or RER line C) and goes to Longchamp-Goodplanet\n\n \nEntry is free and attendees are welcome to wander around the Fondation before or after the event. \nThere is no charge for the event. Freshers will be offered two complementary drinks\, while Society members can purchase their refreshments at the ClairiÃ¨re’s bar.

SUMMARY:A walk along the Aqueduc MÃ©dicis to the Observatoire
DESCRIPTION:George Young has developed a new walk which willÂ follow the trace in Paris of the Aqueduc MÃ©dicis\, constructed in the early 17th century to supply water to among other things Queen Marie de MÃ©dicisâ€™ new palace of Luxembourg.  \nIt generally follows the line of the Roman aqueduct of which some remains may be seen. The route also passes by the Observatoire\, and the Paris meridian used by the French until they finally accepted the Greenwich meridian in 1911! \n \nThe walk will start at the Parc Montsouris\, first laid out under Napoleon III in imitation of London parks\, and finish at the Jardin du Luxembourg. It will take approximately two and a half hours. Afterwards\, for those wishing it\, a lunch reservation can be made in a brasserie near to the Jardin du Luxembourg. \nThis event is a walk and so aimed at those with reasonable mobility. It is recommended that you wear comfortable shoes\, suitable for walking. You should also consider bringing a raincoat or umbrella if the weather on the day is not fair. \nWe will meet at 10am sharp at RER B Station CitÃ© Universitaire. The end point will be the Fontaine MÃ©dicis\, close to RER B Luxembourg\, but MÃ©tro OdÃ©on (lines 4 and 10) is also not far. \nThere is no charge for this event. There may be an opportunity to take refreshments during the walk\, so please bring enough money to buy your own drinks and your lunch if you decide to stay on. \nGuests are welcome\, but numbers are strictly limited to 20\, and places will be allocated on a first-come\, first-served basis. When you book\, please indicate if you intend to stay on for lunch so that places can be reserved in the restaurant.

SUMMARY:Peter Elliott - The â€˜artâ€™ of self-publishing: a view by a Trinity lawyer\, an escapist into history
DESCRIPTION:Peter will tell a story of a Cambridge Law tripos student\, who should have read history\, but devoted a career to law\, and then in retirement switched back to his first love\, history. \nFrom his rustic base in the Languedoc\, far from sophisticated libraries\, Peter carries out most of his research remotely. He will cover: \n\nuse of archives\, libraries\, databases;\nbuilding a network relating to the subject and topic; –\ncombining text and image to tell a story;\nhe art of self -publishing\, and in particular use of the KDP Amazon self-platform.\n\nPeter Elliott: \n \nAfter leaving Â school in South Africa\, and gaining a first degree at Cape Town University\, Peter Elliott won a national scholarship to Cambridge in 1971\, where he read law at Trinity (1971-1974). After graduating he qualified as a solicitor and pursued a legal career in England\, in private practice and in industry. After retiring at the end 2011\, he and his wife Maddy moved to the Languedoc\, France\, where they live surrounded by vines\, in a landscape not unlike parts of the Western Cape. \nPeterâ€™s lifelong interest in history Â drew him to biography. He has researched and published five titles\, Â all with some focus on his country of origin\, South Africa. Two are distinctly art biographies\, but also tell a social and political history.

SUMMARY:Dr Peter Hicks - Napoleon and the British\, before and during St Helena
DESCRIPTION:The first ever biographies of Napoleon were written not in French but in English\, the only serious biographies of the Consul and later Emperor were written in the same language and during his lifetime. During both of his abdications and exiles\, â€˜Boneyâ€™ was frequently the subject of book\, newspaper articles\, etc. The exile on St Helena was to provide for the springboard for an obsession in the English-language world that lasts to this day. My talk will discuss this little-known\, British part in the telling of the Napoleon story. \n \nPeter Hicks is an historian of the Napoleonic period and International Affairs manager at the Fondation NapolÃ©on\, Paris. He was Visiting Professor at the University of Bath (UK) (2008-2018) and is an Honorary Fellow of the Institute on Napoleon and the French Revolution\, Florida State University\, USA.

His recent books include â€“Â  (ed.)\, Emmanuel de Las Cases\, Le MÃ©morial de Sainte HÃ©lÃ¨ne: Le manuscript retrouvÃ©\, critical edition\, with presentation and commentary with Thierry Lentz\, FranÃ§ois Houdecek and Chantal Prevot\, Perrin 2017\, (ed.) La bataille de Waterloo : symbole de victoire\, de dÃ©faite et lieu de mÃ©moire/Battle of Waterloo : Introductions to the Lectures and After-Thoughts â€“ in English\, (Les Ã©ditions de la Belle alliance\, 2015) and The Napoleonic Empire and the New European Political Culture\, with Michael Broers and Agustin Guimera\, (Palgrave Macmillan\, 2012). His current publication projects include: joint-editor of volume 3 of Cambridge History of the Napoleonic Wars\, (CUP 2020)\, a selection of British witnesses to Napoleon on St Helena (Perrin 2021).

SUMMARY:Martin Rees - The World in 2050 - and Beyond
DESCRIPTION:Martin Rees\, Baron Rees of Ludlow\,Â OM\, FRS\, FREng\, FMedSci\, FRASÂ is aÂ BritishÂ cosmologistÂ andÂ astrophysicist. He has beenÂ Astronomer RoyalÂ since 1995Â and wasÂ MasterÂ ofÂ Trinity College\, CambridgeÂ from 2004 to 2012 andÂ President of the Royal SocietyÂ between 2005 and 2010. \nMartinâ€™s field is astronomy where he has achieved many important results\, and recently Martin has founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University\, where he studies the fundamental threats and risks to humanity. \nIn his book\, “On the Future: Prospects for Humanity” published in 2018\, he demonstrates that humanity has reached a critical moment. Our world is unsettled and rapidly changing\, and we face existential risks over the next century. Various outcomesâ€”good and badâ€”are possible. Yet our approach to the future is characterized by short-term thinking\, polarizing debates\, alarmist rhetoric\, and pessimism. In this short\, exhilarating book\, Martin argues that humanityâ€™s prospects depend on our taking a very different approach to planning for tomorrow.

SUMMARY:Oxford and Cambridge Poetry and Prose Reading
DESCRIPTION:We are pleased to announce the third Oxford and Cambridge virtual prose and poetry reading on Tuesday 25th May at 7pm. It will take place on Zoom.\nThis event is open & without charge to all members of both Societies. Please register on the Cambridge website to participate. \nThis month\, we have decided that we need to anticipate the end of the restrictions on our movements we have endured on and off for over a year now\, but in particular in April when we were pretty much limited to a circle of 10 kms around our homes. This means that the theme of the readings is â€œTravellingâ€. Each reader should plan to come with two readings\, each of 3 to 5 minutes (maximum) long. \nThus\, in the 90 minutes available\, you can expect to read both pieces. Paul Tracy (Oxford) will again act as moderator for the evening.

SUMMARY:Robert W Hanning - Stories for an Uncertain World
DESCRIPTION:The social fabric of human communities is woven primarily from the creation\, transmission\, and reception of stories.Â  Is it merely an accident that Western Europeâ€™s two greatest tale collections originated within a long generation of each other\, or is there something important we can learn about the culture of late medieval European civilization from a comparison of Giovanni Boccaccioâ€™s Decameron (1350s) and Geoffrey Chaucerâ€™s Canterbury Tales (1380s-early 1390s)?Â  In fact\, for all their differences\, the Decameron and the Canterbury Tales frequently align in telling â€œstories for an uncertain worldâ€â€”a world shown to be challenged by radical uncertainties of knowledge\, perception\, and strategy\, and lacking the serene comfort of faith in Divine Providence so often thought to characterize the medieval centuries. Â A comparison of passages\, and stories\, from both collections suggests instead that the necessary and proper response to their world is to deploy skills of calculation and deliberation that generate deeds\, and supporting words\, designed to control\, as much as is possible\, lifeâ€™s ever changing circumstances.Â  Seen from this perspective\, the frequent goal in these wonderfully told tales is not salvation but agency\, Â and the appropriate virtue\, rather than holiness\, is a modified version of what Aristotle called â€œpractical wisdomâ€ (phrÃ³nesis) and we\, following Cicero\, call prudence (prudentia). Â  \n******* \nRobert W. Hanning\, Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University\, holds degrees from Columbia and Oxford.Â  Recipient of Guggenheim\, ACLS\, NEH\, and Rockefeller Foundation Fellowships\, he gave the New Chaucer Societyâ€™s Biennial Chaucer Lecture in 1998 at the Sorbonne.Â  He has published three books on classical\, medieval\, and Renaissance subjects and has co-translated two major medieval French texts.Â  His monograph\, â€œStories for an Uncertain World: Agency in Boccaccioâ€™s Decameron and Chaucerâ€™s Canterbury Tales\,â€ is to be published by Oxford University Press.

SUMMARY:How can business benefit from the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement? Opportunities and Challenges
DESCRIPTION:The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement was hailed as the resolution to the long-running negotiations between Britain and the EU just before Christmas. But how should my business be using it? Is it as effective as businesses would like in the key areas that affect them? How can my business seize any opportunities? \nThese questions and many more are at the front of our minds as everyone tries to work out what the Agreement really means. \nWe are delighted to welcome two eminent experts in the field to a Forum on how business can deal with the Agreement\, Catherine Barnard from Cambridge University and Paul Taylor from the Department for International Trade at the British Embassy in Paris. They will cover the key aspects of the Agreement\, but above all we hope to cover those issues your business is facing and answer your questions. When you register\, you will be invited to let us know what topics interest you and what your questions are. There will also be the opportunity to ask your questions during the Forum. \nCatherine Barnard \n \nCatherine Barnard is Professor of EU law and Employment Law and senior tutor and fellow of Trinity College.Â  She is the author of EU Employment Law (Oxford\, OUP\, 2012\, 5th ed.)\, The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms\, (Oxford\, OUP\, 2016\, 5th ed)\, and (with Peers ed)\, European Union Law (Oxford\, OUP\, 2017\, 2nd ed) . She is currently a Senior Fellow in the UK in a Changing Europe (http://ukandeu.ac.uk/) project. This is an authoritative\, non-partisan think tank which does research and provides information about all aspects of Brexit. Part of its remit is to make that information accessible to the general public. So it does a lot of public engagement\, especially with the media.Â  She has appeared extensively on the main media channels – BBC\, ITV and Sky – as well as some of the more specialist programmes such as Law in Action\, Woman’s Hour and the Briefing Room. She has also written for the Guardian and the Telegraph. She has given evidence to numerous select committees on the legal issues connected with Brexit\, immigration and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act. \nPaul Taylor \n \nPaul Taylor took up the role of Chief Operating Officer\, Department for International Trade\, at the British Embassy in Paris in May 2016. Immediately prior to his arrival in France\, Paul spent five years in Prague as Regional Director for Trade & Investment with Central and South Eastern Europe. Paulâ€™s Government career encompasses both the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Trade. Previous responsibilities in Whitehall include managing bilateral relations with South America and\, subsequently\, the Middle East & North Africa; while other overseas experience includes diplomatic postings to the British Embassies in Mexico City\, Santiago and Madrid.

SUMMARY:Achievements and Challenges in Weather Forecasting
DESCRIPTION:Advances in weather modelling have been driven as much by technological development as by improvements in weather science. The most notable of these are the rapid increases in supercomputer power and improvements in Earth observations from space. Rapidly improving modelling capability enabled by this technology has led to 3-day weather forecasts today being as accurate as 1-day forecasts were 20 years ago. \n \nDr Vicky Pope (Girton) will outline some of these improvements and where further improvements are still needed. Vicky is an honorary Professor at the Science Technology Engineering and Public Policy Institute at University College London. She had a long and varied career in the Met Office. She worked for many years on climate change. She led the development of some of the best climate models in the world and later ran the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme\, acting as the interface between scientists and government and other key stakeholders including the media.

SUMMARY:Oxford and Cambridge Paris Poetry and Prose Reading
DESCRIPTION:Developing the theme of the Play Readings that were organised for the enjoyment of members of both the Oxford and Cambridge Societies in Paris\, we have organised a Poetry or Prose reading evening\, on Wednesday 6th January 2021 at 7pm. \nThis date has been chosen both as it coincides with the First Wednesday in 2021\, and so we hope will help compensate for the continued absence of Monthly Drinks evenings\, and also it is Epiphany which might offer a theme\, if you choose to adopt it\, for your reading. \nThe Cambridge Society has kindly agreed to lead the event\, which will be hosted on Zoom.Â  A meeting link will be sent to all registered attendees two or three days before of the event. \nEach participant will be invited to select their choice of readings\, in English\, ideally each up to three minutes long. For the more adventurous\, you can of course write your own. We expect you will have the opportunity of reading at least twice.

SUMMARY:Christmas Baking - Making the perfect mince pie from A to Z
DESCRIPTION:Making the perfect mince pie from A to Z – a tutorial with demonstrations by Sky Quinn \nSky\, our Presidentâ€™s 14 year old London-based grandson\, is an enthusiastic cook. He has taken twoÂ courses at Prue Leith’sÂ School of Food and Wine in London. Last year he got into the last 30 of the BBC junior Bake Off but was told he would be more suitable for the adult competition when he is old enough. He has made a good income for pocket money by cooking full dinners for his parentsâ€™ friends and neighbours. He is very interested in and knowledgeable about the history of food and recently made for his family a Mince Pie from a 16th century recipe (with real meat). \nAware that lockdown has prevented many of us from going over to the UK for our usual seasonal shopping\, we hope this will give you the tricks and tips you need to make your own mince pies to enjoy on Christmas Day. \nThe demonstration will be shown on Zoom at 4pm on Saturday 5th December. The access link to join will be sent to registered participants a couple of days before the event. \nBook now to avoid disappointment.
