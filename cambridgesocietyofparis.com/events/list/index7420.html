SUMMARY:Presentation by Solange Manche and Annual General Meeting
DESCRIPTION:Solange Manche\, a beneficiary of the Trevor Brown Bursary in 2020 to support her change year at the Ecole Normale Supérieur\, will give a presentation on “Finance’s Phineas Gage: Thinking Financialization and Subject Formation with Contemporary French Thought”. \nIn this talk\, Solange will present how the thought of Stiegler\, Malabou\, and Lordon can shed a new light upon the way we think about the relation between individuation and financialization. \nAfter the 2007-2008 financial crash\, it became clear that finance is not limited to the screens of the stock exchange. Finance has now become so entangled with our daily existence that theoretical and philosophical considerations of financialization have declared the emergence of a new subject\, starting with Michel Foucault’s entrepreneur of the self. \nSince then\, a number of subjects have been added to the list: Randy Martin’s financialized self\, Paul Langley’s Foucauldian uncertain subject\, Maurizio Lazzarato’s indebted man\, Rob Aitken’s bodies that are turned into objects for financial income\, Michel Feher’s rated agents\, and most recently Aris Komporozos-Athanasiou’s homo speculans. \nWhereas these accounts remain primarily Foucauldian and Deleuzian\, Solange will argue that the new milieu that finance gives rise to is also the background from which Stiegler’s\, Malabou’s\, and Lordon’s ontologies have developed\, thereby offering theoretical tools that are more appropriate to our times. \n \nSolange Manche is a PhD candidate in French\, working on the thought of Bernard Stiegler\, Catherine Malabou\, and Frédéric Lordon. She in particular explores how their ontologies inform their critique of contemporary capitalism and brings their perspective to financialization studies. \nThe talk will be preceded at 7pm by the Society’s Annual General Meeting. The “formal” notice of meeting and other papers relating to the AGM will be sent to members in early May. \nPlease register your attendance at the talk and the AGM  using the booking section below – just click on the “+” button to the right of the quantity field in the tickets box and then click on “get tickets” and proceed to checkout. \nGuests are welcome\, although of course they will not be able to vote at the AGM so they may prefer to arrive at 8pm just for the talk. \nTickets are free and light refreshments will be served.

SUMMARY:The Gemini Boat Races
DESCRIPTION:The Gemini Boat Race \nwill return to the Thames this year. \n\n \nCome along to cheer on the Light Blues at The Bowler\, 13 rue d’Artois\, 75008 Paris. \nWe have arranged for both the Ladies’ and the Men’s races to be shown on the Bowler’s big screen so that we can meet up with our friends from the Other Place. The stakes are\, of course\, getting higher for Cambridge as we are on an impressive run of victories in both races. \nThe Ladies’ race starts at 15:23 French time\, with the Men’s race one hour later\, so reserve your afternoon to come along and show your support. The Bowler serves reasonably priced pub meals\, so why not make a full afternoon of it and have lunch before the rowing starts. \nAlthough there is no need to book\, we will appreciate it if you let us know by email that you intend to come along so we can confirm approximate numbers to The Bowler.

SUMMARY:CamSoc Paris - Jean Khalfa talk 11 March 2022
DESCRIPTION:Jean Khalfa is a Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge who specialises in the history of philosophy\, modern literature (in particular contemporary poetry and writing in French from North Africa and the Caribbean)\, aesthetics and anthropology. He is also a member of the Council of the Ecole Normale Supérieure. \n \nJean will give us a talk on Wifredo Lam and XXth century livres d’artiste at the Amphithéâtre Marie Curie\, 1 rue Pierre et Marie Curie\, 75005 Paris (RER B Luxembourg\, Metro line 7 Place Monge\, Metro line 10 Cardinal Lemoine). This is the lecture hall where Marie Curie gave her lectures in the first decade of the 20th Century and it retains much of the format and atmosphere from that time. Jean’s topic would follow well the current Picasso exhibition (https://www.palais-portedoree.fr/fr/node/109187) for those who have been or are planning to go to that – it runs until 13th February at the Palais de la Porte Dorée. \nThe Wren library at Trinity College has one of the greatest collections of XXth century artists’ books. A  set of books by the Cuban/French painter Wifredo Lam has recently been added to the collection. Lam was a protégé of Picasso before WWII and became one of the greatest painters of the second half of the century. \n \nHis painting La Jungle is usually displayed in New York’s MoMA next to Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. His work as a painter was considerable and is on display in countless museums\, but what is less well known is that Lam produced some of the greatest books of the period\, in dialogue with the most significant poets. \nThis talk will be an opportunity to discover this artist\, to better understand the genre of the “livre d’artiste”\, and to learn how I managed to get these extraordinary books to Cambridge. \nTo find out more about the collection: \nWilfredo Lam: Livres d’Artiste – part one of article published on 29th May 2018 \nWilfredo Lam: Livres d’Artiste – part two of article published on 4th June 2018 \nParticipants will be welcomed with a coffee\, available from 6pm\, and the lecture will begin at 7pm. Tickets are €25 per person and can be booked using the link below (click on the “+” button to select the number of tickets required).

SUMMARY:PADFAS - Zoom Lecture on Paul Strand
DESCRIPTION:PADFAS (The Arts Society Paris) invites members of the Cambridge Society of Paris to join their Live online Zoom lecture on Thursday 17th February\, 2022 at 14.00. \nDeborah Jenner will present Paul Strand’s “Straight Photography”.\n \nPaul Strand’s sharply focused Straight Photography elevated this Machine Age tool – a camera – to a medium of Fine Art through exquisitely composed images in highly contrasted tones of black and white. His 1915 shot of “Wall Street” extracted the ready-made (yet hidden) symbols of J P Morgan’s bank façade to reveal parallels with Di Vinci’s Last Supper mural. It suggests the misplaced sanctity of modern financial institutions. Strand’s 1922 article on The New Trilogy (making “God\, Christ\, and the Holy Ghost” into “the machine\, materialism and science”) clearly criticises the Industrial Age’s worshipping of false gods. His and Charles Sheeler’s chillingly still and vacated views of Henry Ford’s River Rouge automobile plant portray it as a soulless cathedral. \nStrand was always there at the cutting edge from Gallery 291 and NYC Dada to documentary filmmaking in LA & Mexico. Banished from the USA during the McCarthy Era\, he travelled the world’s political hotspots to finally settle in France compiling photo-book portraits of place. Ever shooting iconic views\, his objective\, mechanical recording of reality ironically reveals the subjectivity of all human vision. \nDeborah Jenner is an American-born art historian; member of College Arts Association. Residing in Paris since 1990\, she has worked at the Ecole du Louvre\, the Sorbonne\, the Catholic Institute and the British Council. Her Doctorate thesis proved non-western influences in Georgia O’Keeffe’s art. Her publications include catalogue essays for Musée d’Orsay (New York City et l’Art modern) and Centre Pompidou (Les Traces du Sacré)\, scholarly papers with the research laboratory S.A.R.I. and Gallery critiques in ArtAsiaPacific\, and PerformArts: Artvisuel-Artvivant. She gives public talks\, guided walks and museum tours for ex-pat organisations and study-abroad programs and volunteers as an Al Gore Climate leader and JCF Round Table coordinator. She is a member of The Arts Society Paris. \nPlease book your free place directly with PADFAS by using this link.
