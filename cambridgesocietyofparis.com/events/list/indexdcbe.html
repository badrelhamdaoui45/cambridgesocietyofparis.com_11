SUMMARY:BONAPARTE and the CODE CIVIL: Une aventure insoupçonnée
DESCRIPTION:Dear Friends\,\nWe are delighted to invite you to a talk by one of our friends and member of the ESU Paris on a date-making subject which was raised after our visit to the Musée de la Légion d’Honneur: \nBONAPARTE and the CODE CIVIL\nUne aventure insoupçonnée \nJacqueline Lafon taught the History of Law at Paris Sorbonne and has published in France and in the USA. She has kindly accepted to talk to us about an extraordinary and unexpected adventure:… \nIn August 1799\, when he was in Cairo\, Bonaparte was informed of the dramatic situation in France. Upon his return to France\, a newspaper “Le Messager” declared – “ everyone is expecting Bonaparte as he is the only one who brings hope to the country.” \nThen followed the Coup d’Etat on 18 Brumaire An VIII. Bonaparte First Consul benefited from all powers to restore the State based on a solid law applied in the entire country. He imposed the creation of specific committees to write down the rules or codification on the main subjects – civil law\, criminal law\, commercial law\, procedure. \nOutstanding lawyers who used to practise before the Revolution were selected. That was the beginning of the adventure… \nThe talk will take place at the Mairie of the 7th arrondissement\,\n116 rue de Grenelle 75 007 Paris\non Thursday 8 February 2024 at 6.30pm. \nPlease send your answer to Luce Loussouarn\, ljloussouarn@free.fr\, before February 5th \, as we have to send the list of participants to the Mairie. \nYou may invite your friends to this event. \nLuce Loussouarn\nPresident Esu Paris \nName………………………………………………………………\nPhone number or email address:………………………………………….\nWill attend the talk Bonaparte and the Code Civil on February 8th.
