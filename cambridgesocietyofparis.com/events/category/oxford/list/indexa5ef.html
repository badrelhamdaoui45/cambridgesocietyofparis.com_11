SUMMARY:Oxford Society Dinner on Saturday 16th November
DESCRIPTION:All places available for this event have now been allocated. You may apply to be put on the waiting list\, but a place will only be allocated if there are cancellations. \nThe President and Committee of the Oxford University Society in Paris are pleased to invite you to a dinner at which our speaker will be Dr. Philip Mansel\, FRHistS\, Chevalier de lâ€™Ordre des Arts et Lettres\, who will give us an illustrated talk on \nÂ â€œLouis XIV and the English: from Francophobia to Francophiliaâ€ \nDate :Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Saturday\, 16th November 2019YouÂ  \nTime :Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  6.00 for 6.30 pm apÃ©ritif\, 7.00 pm dinner* \nVenue : Â Â Â  Â  Le SÃ©nat\, Palais du Luxembourg\,Â  15 ter rue de Vaugirard\, 75006 Paris \nDress :Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Lounge suits \n*N.B. Please note that the Senate will close its doors at 7.00 pm and that no admission will be possible after that time. So\, if you will be attending the dinner\, please make sure you arrive WELL BEFORE 7.00 pm. \nBookings are managed by the Oxford Society. Please use their registration form to reserve your places. \nPhilip Mansel read Modern History and Modern Languages at Balliol (1970) and received his doctorate on the French Court under the Restoration Monarchy from UCL. His first book\, Louis XVIII\, published in 1981\, together with his subsequent works\, such as The Court of France 1789-1830 and Paris Between Empires 1814-1852\, established him as an authority on the French Monarchy during its Restoration after the French Revolution and the July Monarchy. \nIn 1995\, Philip Mansel founded the Society for Court Studies\, together with David Starkey and others. He has also published books related to the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. He has contributed numerous reviews and articles to well-known newspapers and journals and received many awards and decorations. \nIt may seem surprising\, but despite the wealth of historical writing devoted to the period\, Philip Manselâ€™s biography\, â€œKing of the World: The Life of Louis XIVâ€\, published in July of this year [*]\, is by far the most comprehensive and up-to-date biography of â€œthe Sun Kingâ€. Going far beyond an account of the public events of the reign which are perhaps better-known\, Philip Mansel explores the monarchâ€™s contradictions and his inner life\, and presents a masterly depiction of the internal workings of his Court. He has achieved the feat of producing a biography which is both impeccably scholarly and immensely readable! \nThe dinner will be held in the splendid Salon Pourpre dining room of the Senate. \nPrices\, which include an aperitif and a 3-course dinner with wine and coffee\, are: \n\nmembers of OUSP\, OBA and CamSoc + 1 guest: â‚¬65 per person\njunior members <30 years old and current students + 1 guest: â‚¬49 pp\nnon-member alumni + additional guests: â‚¬75 pp\n\nPayment can be made \n\neither by cheque made out to OUSP\,\nÂ orÂ by bank transfer (details in attached Registration form).\n\nIf you wish to join us for the dinner\, please complete and return the attached Registration form as soon as possible and in any event for receipt by no later than Monday\, 4th November\, 2019. \nAs we are unable to increase the number of places reserved at the venue\, we recommend early registration to avoid disappointment. Registrations will be treated on a â€˜first come\, first servedâ€™ basis and will be individually confirmed. \nMembers must provide their full names and those of their guests to be communicated to the Senate beforehand and photographic identity documents may be required for access to it on the evening. \nWe look forward to seeing you at the dinner. \nBest wishes\, \nCarol Amouyel Kent \nPresident Oxford Society of Paris \n[*] A number of copies will be available for sale at a discount.

SUMMARY:Oxford and Cambridge Talk : The Menace of Monolinguism
DESCRIPTION:Thurs 28th March – Oxford and Cambridge Talk :Â The Menace of Monolinguism \nIs Monolingualism harming us? Does the study of language benefit the individual and society? Can multilingualism contribute towards our health and well-being\, social cohesion and diplomacy? \nWho better to answer these questions than Wendy Ayers-Bennett\, Professor of French Philology and Linguistics at the University of Cambridge and Professorial Fellow in Linguistics at Murray Edwards College\, Cambridge. \nWendy Ayres-Bennett obtained her BA and MA studying Modern Languages\, French and German\, at Girton College\, Cambridge and has since specialised in the evolution and history of the French language and the history of linguistic thought. She has had six posts as a Visiting Professor in France and is a Principal Investigator on the MEITS project\, Â Multilingualism; Empowering Individuals\, Transforming Societies. Her books include a History of the French Language and Problems and Perspectives; Studies in the Modern French Language. \nThe lecture is taking place atÂ 18 rue BonaparteÂ where we are the guests of the Czech Cultural Centre. This property has close ties to the history of Czechoslovakia\, having been used by a number of Czech organisations\, including the Sokol movement\, and was the base from which Edward Benes\, future President of Czechoslovakia\, with T.G. Masaryk and M.R. Stefanik organised a Czecho-Slovak army to fight for the Western Allies in France. \n

SUMMARY:Oxford Society: George Farquhar's "The Beaux' Strategem" Play Reading
DESCRIPTION:Oxford play reading onÂ Tuesday 12th June\, from 7pm – the Restoration comedy\,Â George Farquhar’s “The Beaux’ Strategem”. \nOur next Play reading will be held onÂ Tuesday\, 12th. June\, from 7pm\, when Paul Tracy (Oriel) has again kindly offer to lead us\, this time in reading the Restoration comedy\,Â George Farquhar’s “The Beaux’ Strategem”. \nAs usual\, it will be held at the RBL Clubroom: \nThe Royal British LegionÂ \n28\, rue des Acacias\n75017 Paris\nStreet door code: AA58 \nIn the courtyard\, first door to the right\, then door on the left (ground floor) \nAs usual there will be a participation of â‚¬5 per person\, payable in cash on the night. \n  \n  \nPaul writes: \nIn 1660\, Charles II returned from exile in France following the death of Cromwell. Not only was the new king fond of the theatre\, which he had enjoyed in France\, but after the ban on all theatres imposed by the Puritans in England in 1642\, Londoners were keen to rediscover the delights that had been popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean times. \nTwo theatre companies were set up in Drury Lane and the Haymarket which triggered an immediate flowering of drama from writers such as Dryden\, Etherege\, Rochester and Wycherley\, followed some years later by Congreve\, Vanburgh\, and George Farquhar. The best plays of the period were comedies\, or more precisely satires poking fun at all strata of society. They were written in a combination of wit and sometimes fairly coarse language. The Restoration period also saw the first appearance of women acting female parts\, much encouraged by Charles II. \nWilliam III\, the Dutchman who acceded to the throne in 1689\, disapproved of the theatre and this type of comedy eventually disappeared with the Hanoverian succession in 1714. \nThe Beauxâ€™ Stratagem\, first performed in 1707\, was Farquharâ€™s last and most successful play. He died a month later aged 30. The play was frequently revived up to 1800\, notably by David Garrick\, and then disappeared until the 1920â€™s. The play hinges on the two beauxâ€™ decision to travel as master and servant to help them marry into a fortune. \nThe play is available on the Gutenberg web site free of charge and also easily found 2ndÂ hand on various other sites. \nPlease advise Roger Thorn if you can make it and we look forward to seeing as many of you as can come. \nRoger Thorn\nroger.thorn@wanadoo.fr\nFixed line: 01 34 80 13 33\nMobile: 07 86 36 93 58
