SUMMARY:The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture: Gene Machine
DESCRIPTION:Thurs 7th March 2019 â€“ The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture: Â Gene Machine\nThe race for the structure of the ribosome â€” a study in the sociology of science\nEveryone has heard of DNA â€” the molecule that seems to hold the secrets of all life\, but hardly anyone has heard of the ribosome. While DNA is the blueprint for life it rests inertly within our cells. The ribosome is an enormous molecular machine\, even more ancient than DNA that translates the information in our genes into proteins. These proteins in turn make up much of our bodies and catalyse thousands of processes within our cells. \nA ribosome is a machine no cell can do without\, but until recently\, how this machine worked was a mystery. As well as being essential for life\, its practical importance also lies in the fact that the ribosome is the target of many major antibiotics. A knowledge of the structure of the ribosome is the key to the development of new treatments against deadly infections\, so crucial for the future of mankind. \nIn his lecture Venki Ramakrishnan will outline the extraordinary race between groups of scientists around the world to be the first to uncover the structure of this central element of the human body. It is a story of high science\, rivalry\, generosity and mutual support. In other words it is a story of humanity uncovering one of the secrets of humanity! \nHe will also talk about what he calls the Politics of Recognition in science. It is a well-known adage that the essential first step to a Nobel Prize is to work in a lab where there are already Nobel Laureates â€” is this true and\, if so\, what does this mean? There have been 12 Nobel Prizes for staff of his own lab since it opened in 1958\, as well as 11 for scientists who have spent time there as visitors. \nVenki is group leader at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. In 2009 he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on ribosomal structure and was knighted in 2012. He is a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences\, Leopoldina and EMBO\, and a Foreign Member of the Indian National Science Academy. In 2015\, he was elected as President of the Royal Society for a five-year term.

SUMMARY:Christmas Dinner with Berlin Cabaret
DESCRIPTION:We have privatised oneÂ of the finestÂ Parisian Belle Epoque restaurants andÂ You are invitedÂ to theÂ Cambridge Christmas DinnerÂ with music\, magic and Berlin CabaretÂ 19h30 to 23h30\, Le Zimmer\, ChÃ¢telet\,Â Sunday 25thÂ NovemberÂ 2018. \n\n \nBerlinÂ CabaretÂ makes its dÃ©but in Paris! Â Beguiling\, bewigged and Baroque\, Claudia Roick and Nicole Tschaikin\, performing as the exotic Baroque Bitches\, are stars of the cabaret scene in Berlin. Now\, by invitation from the Cambridge Society of Paris\, they are making their dÃ©but in Paris. This will be something completely different! Sopranos with the voices of angels\, these are no cherubins! But Claudia and Nicole will bewitch you with their outstanding OpÃ©ra VariÃ©tÃ© bringing a whole new perspective to opera\, operetta and Kurt Weil. Perfectly rendered classical and 1920s music with a twist. Wow! \n  \n\n\n\n\nLe Zimmer\nAfter the war of 1870\, some wealthy families from Alsace wanted to remain French Citizens. To do so\, they moved to Paris and founded brasseries. The Zimmers were amongst them\, and their restaurant remains as one of the finest Belle Epoque restaurants in Paris\, recently decorated by Jacques Garcia. Formerly the stamping ground of Sarah Bernhardt\, Richard Strauss\, Emile Zola\, Picasso\, and Toulouse Lautrec\, we have privatised the entire restaurant for a great party; the Cambridge Christmas Dinner\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic and MagicÂ When you arrive\, as you take your aperitifs\, champagne and kir\, charleston\, swing and boogie woogie music will be played by Christophe Benz\, Paul Marcorelles and Bruno DuyÃ© at the piano\, clarinettist Annie Terramorsi and Thomas Racine Â percussion. Â DuringÂ dinner\, Jean- Pierre Crispon conjuror from the Double Fond theatre of magic will pass from table to table performing unbelievable feats of magic: coins that appear and disappear\, cards that defy reason\, maybe even a dove that descends.

DESCRIPTION:THE DEBATEÂ \n\n\n\n\nOxford and Cambridge Challenge Debate\, Monday 22ndÂ October: Â Last year the Cambridge Society of Paris challenged the Union Debating Society to a debate which was held in the HÃ´tel Paiva.

The event will be held at Le Connetable restaurant in the Marais\, at 55 rue des Archives\, and the motion will beÂ â€œThis House believes that President Trump is doing a good job for Americaâ€.Â Edward Archer and Pierre Caquet will be speaking for Cambridge\, and Oxford will field two of their best speakers in response.The evening will start with an aperitif at 19h\, followed by dinner in the delightful candlelit Le Connetable restaurant where we have privatised the whole of the first floor\, all for a price of 35â‚¬\, including drinks and coffee.Â The debate will take place at the end of dinner\, and the evening will close at 22h. This should be a most convivial and interesting evening\, with an excellent dinner\, and we would be delighted if you and your guests would like to attend.

SUMMARY:Oxford Society: George Farquhar's "The Beaux' Strategem" Play Reading
DESCRIPTION:Oxford play reading onÂ Tuesday 12th June\, from 7pm – the Restoration comedy\,Â George Farquhar’s “The Beaux’ Strategem”. \nOur next Play reading will be held onÂ Tuesday\, 12th. June\, from 7pm\, when Paul Tracy (Oriel) has again kindly offer to lead us\, this time in reading the Restoration comedy\,Â George Farquhar’s “The Beaux’ Strategem”. \nAs usual\, it will be held at the RBL Clubroom: \nThe Royal British LegionÂ \n28\, rue des Acacias\n75017 Paris\nStreet door code: AA58 \nIn the courtyard\, first door to the right\, then door on the left (ground floor) \nAs usual there will be a participation of â‚¬5 per person\, payable in cash on the night. \n  \n  \nPaul writes: \nIn 1660\, Charles II returned from exile in France following the death of Cromwell. Not only was the new king fond of the theatre\, which he had enjoyed in France\, but after the ban on all theatres imposed by the Puritans in England in 1642\, Londoners were keen to rediscover the delights that had been popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean times. \nTwo theatre companies were set up in Drury Lane and the Haymarket which triggered an immediate flowering of drama from writers such as Dryden\, Etherege\, Rochester and Wycherley\, followed some years later by Congreve\, Vanburgh\, and George Farquhar. The best plays of the period were comedies\, or more precisely satires poking fun at all strata of society. They were written in a combination of wit and sometimes fairly coarse language. The Restoration period also saw the first appearance of women acting female parts\, much encouraged by Charles II. \nWilliam III\, the Dutchman who acceded to the throne in 1689\, disapproved of the theatre and this type of comedy eventually disappeared with the Hanoverian succession in 1714. \nThe Beauxâ€™ Stratagem\, first performed in 1707\, was Farquharâ€™s last and most successful play. He died a month later aged 30. The play was frequently revived up to 1800\, notably by David Garrick\, and then disappeared until the 1920â€™s. The play hinges on the two beauxâ€™ decision to travel as master and servant to help them marry into a fortune. \nThe play is available on the Gutenberg web site free of charge and also easily found 2ndÂ hand on various other sites. \nPlease advise Roger Thorn if you can make it and we look forward to seeing as many of you as can come. \nRoger Thorn\nroger.thorn@wanadoo.fr\nFixed line: 01 34 80 13 33\nMobile: 07 86 36 93 58
