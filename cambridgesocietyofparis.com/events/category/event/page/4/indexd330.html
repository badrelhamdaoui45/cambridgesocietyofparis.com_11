SUMMARY:Oxford Society: George Farquhar's "The Beaux' Strategem" Play Reading
DESCRIPTION:Oxford play reading onÂ Tuesday 12th June\, from 7pm – the Restoration comedy\,Â George Farquhar’s “The Beaux’ Strategem”. \nOur next Play reading will be held onÂ Tuesday\, 12th. June\, from 7pm\, when Paul Tracy (Oriel) has again kindly offer to lead us\, this time in reading the Restoration comedy\,Â George Farquhar’s “The Beaux’ Strategem”. \nAs usual\, it will be held at the RBL Clubroom: \nThe Royal British LegionÂ \n28\, rue des Acacias\n75017 Paris\nStreet door code: AA58 \nIn the courtyard\, first door to the right\, then door on the left (ground floor) \nAs usual there will be a participation of â‚¬5 per person\, payable in cash on the night. \n  \n  \nPaul writes: \nIn 1660\, Charles II returned from exile in France following the death of Cromwell. Not only was the new king fond of the theatre\, which he had enjoyed in France\, but after the ban on all theatres imposed by the Puritans in England in 1642\, Londoners were keen to rediscover the delights that had been popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean times. \nTwo theatre companies were set up in Drury Lane and the Haymarket which triggered an immediate flowering of drama from writers such as Dryden\, Etherege\, Rochester and Wycherley\, followed some years later by Congreve\, Vanburgh\, and George Farquhar. The best plays of the period were comedies\, or more precisely satires poking fun at all strata of society. They were written in a combination of wit and sometimes fairly coarse language. The Restoration period also saw the first appearance of women acting female parts\, much encouraged by Charles II. \nWilliam III\, the Dutchman who acceded to the throne in 1689\, disapproved of the theatre and this type of comedy eventually disappeared with the Hanoverian succession in 1714. \nThe Beauxâ€™ Stratagem\, first performed in 1707\, was Farquharâ€™s last and most successful play. He died a month later aged 30. The play was frequently revived up to 1800\, notably by David Garrick\, and then disappeared until the 1920â€™s. The play hinges on the two beauxâ€™ decision to travel as master and servant to help them marry into a fortune. \nThe play is available on the Gutenberg web site free of charge and also easily found 2ndÂ hand on various other sites. \nPlease advise Roger Thorn if you can make it and we look forward to seeing as many of you as can come. \nRoger Thorn\nroger.thorn@wanadoo.fr\nFixed line: 01 34 80 13 33\nMobile: 07 86 36 93 58
