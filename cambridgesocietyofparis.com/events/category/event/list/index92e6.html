His first academic post was as Leathersellers’ Teaching Fellow in French at Fitzwilliam College. He was Senior Tutor for the decade 1982-92. In 1994\, he was appointed to the Chair of French Language and Literature at Royal Holloway\, University of London\, where he was successively Head of Department\, Dean of the Graduate School and Vice-Principal. He has been a Life Fellow of Fitzwilliam since 1994. Before his return to the College\, he was Director of the British Institute in Paris\, now renamed as the University of London Institute in Paris. He has held Visiting Professorships at the University of California at Santa Barbara and at the University of Melbourne. \nHe is Emeritus Professor of French Language and Literature in the University of London. His current research and postgraduate teaching is now in association with Cambridge’s Department of French\, where he was a University Lecturer until 1994 and is now Honorary Professor. His work is focused on late nineteenth-century France and\, in particular\, the relationship between literature and the visual arts in that period. He was made Commandeur dans l’Ordre des Palmes Académiques in 2013 for services to French culture and scholarship.  He has written several books.

SUMMARY:Poetry Reading at the American Cathedral
DESCRIPTION:The American Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Paris  \nPoetry Reading by Sir Michael Edwards\, OBE \n7.00pm Friday 22nd November 2019  \nA novel and charming event combining poetry and music\, in the American Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Paris. \nThe Cathedral of the Holy Trinity\, the American Cathedral in Paris\, has decided to instigate poetry readings in the Cathedral and\, through the Dean and Rector\, the Very Reverend Lucinda Laird\, the Cambridge Society of Paris has been invited to co-host the inaugural event. We are honoured and delighted. \nThis first event will be a reading by Sir Michael Edwards of poems from his latest publication: At the Brasserie Lipp. Following the poetry reading\, there will be a reception with drinks and light snacks\, accompanied by piano music played no one of the magnificent grand pianos at the American Cathedral. \nAs well as the event itself\, for anyone who does not already know the American Cathedral\, this will be a revelation and joy\, being one of the finest examples of English Gothic Revival architecture in Europe\, founded by Dr John Brainerd Morgan\, cousin of J.P. Morgan. \nSir Michael Edwards\, Honorary Fellow of Christâ€™s College\, Cambridge\, is very well known as being the first Englishman ever to have been elected to the CollÃ¨ge de France (2002) and to one of the 40 seats of the AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise (2013). Following his reading\, Sir Michael will make available signed copies of his book\, At the Brasserie Lipp. \nIn the spirit of the occasion\, this event is entirely free of charge\, though there will be a voluntary collection\, to be donated to the cathedral and to cover the costs of the evening. \nYou are very warmly invited to this inaugural and delightful event. \nAndrew Lyndon-Skeggs.

SUMMARY:The second Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture:Â Professor Sir Roger Penrose
DESCRIPTION:BOOKING NOW OPEN \nSECOND CAMBRIDGE CUTTING EDGE LECTURE  \nPROFESSOR SIR ROGER PENROSEÂ   \nâ€œHAWKING POINTS IN THE COSMIC MICROWAVE SKYâ€  \n12 noon Wednesday 23rd October 2019  \nConservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers \n 292 Rue Saint-Martin\, 75003 Paris \nMÃ©tro Arts et MÃ©tiers (lines 3 or 11) or RÃ©aumur-SÃ©bastapol (lines 3 or 4) \nFollowing the resounding success of the first Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture delivered by Sir Venki Ramakrishnan at the Institut Pasteur\, we are immensely lucky to have another scientist of world renown for the second lecture\, Professor Sir Roger Penrose\, and to have been permitted most generously by the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers to hold this lecture in their beautiful\, historic amphitheatre AbbÃ© GrÃ©goire. This event is very highly recommended. \nSir Roger Penrose OM FRS is an English mathematical physicist. He studied at University College London and at St Johnâ€™s College Cambridge and is now the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of mathematics at Oxford. \nThe son of a psychiatrist and geneticist\, grandson of a physiologist\, brother of a physicist and of a chess grandmaster\, Roger Penrose has won numerous prizes and awards and is one of the most important living scientists in the world. He worked closely with Stephen Hawking and appeared in the film\, a Brief History of Time. \nThe work undertaken by Roger Penrose has been wide ranging and of immense importance. Taking but two examples: in 1964 he revolutionised the mathematical tools used to analyse the properties of space time and\, later\, his epoch-making paper â€œGravitational collapse and space time singularitiesâ€ lead to the cosmology of Big Bang and Black Holes which he worked on with Stephen Hawking. \nIn lighter vein\, Roger Penrose also devised the Penrose Triangle which he described as â€œimpossibility in its purest formâ€ which he conveyed to the artist M.C. Escher. \nThe topic of Professor Penroseâ€™s Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture is â€œHawking Points in the Cosmic Microwave Skyâ€ in which he will reveal his theories of cosmology and his scientific belief that our Universe is in fact just one of a series of Universes\, or eons\, each commencing with a Big Bang that had its origins in the dim distant past of a preceding Universe. \nHaving attended one of Roger Penroseâ€™s lectures in London\, I can only say that it was utterly astounding. Deep\, cutting edge\, completely incomprehensible science delivered in a way that was\, anyway superficially\, understandable by all\, holding the audience enthralled. By the end\, my head was spinning with ideas and revelations beyond my wildest expectations. \nOver and above\, there will be the delight of seeing the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers and the beautiful historic amphitheatre AbbÃ© GrÃ©goire\, built in the 1840s\, named after the founder of the Conservatoire\, an important political figure during the French Revolution depicted in Davidâ€™s famous painting The Serment du Jeu de Paume. \nThis lecture by Professor Sir Roger Penrose will probably be a one-off ever and a landmark experience for many. It is definitely not to be missed. \nAndrew Lyndon-Skeggs\nPresident\nCambridge Society of Paris

SUMMARY:Challenge Debate against Trinity College Dublin
DESCRIPTION:Thursday 10th October at 7 pm – Challenge Debate against Trinity College Dublin\nBooking has now closed for this event \nTHIS HOUSE BELIEVES THAT THE BEST IS YET TO COME \nIn similar fashion to our challenge to the Cambridge Union\, two years ago\, the Cambridge Society of Paris has challenged Trinity College Dublin to a debateÂ  and we will be speaking in favour of the motion that the best is yet to come. \nOur speakers\, Andrew Lyndon-Skeggs and Edward Archer\, will be joined by Alan Riding as guest speaker. Alan graduated from Bristol University and was\, for 30 years\, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times. Alan spent two decades covering Latin Americaâ€™s dictatorship\, armed rebellions\, drug wars and economic meltdown. He was later the newspaperâ€™s Paris bureau chief and European cultural correspondent. He is author of books on Mexico\, Shakespeare and Opera and\, most recently\, of â€œAnd The Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-occupied Paris.â€ He remains a resident of Paris. Andrew and Edward need little introduction to most of our members\, Andrew being the current President and Edward a past President of our Society. \nTCD have put forward an impressive team\, with Edward Donalon\, Declan McCavana and their guest speaker David Doyle. David is H.E Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO of St. Kitts and Nevis\, while Declan is President of the French Debating Association. Edward is a Barrister and worked for the OECD before becoming an independent consultant in Regulatory Management. \nHE Ambassador of Ireland to France Patricia O’Brien has kindly agreed to host the debate\, which will take place at the Irish Embassy\, 12 Avenue Foch\, 75116 Paris. The Debate will be followed by drinks and the event is expected to conclude at 8:45 pm. \nTickets are now on sale: â‚¬20 per person for Society members and their guests\, with a discounted price of â‚¬10 per person for members or guests under 30 years of age. Early booking is recommended as we anticipate that demand may exceed the number of places that have been allocated to us. For members who are not able to book their place through the website\, a PDF booking form can be obtained by contacting Tony Banton on admin@camsocparis.org. \nUnless all tickets are sold before\, the final date for booking your place is Sunday 6th October\, as the list of participants then has to be provided to the Embassy’s security staff. \nAs the debate takes place in the Irish Embassy\, members and guests must bring photographic ID in order to be admitted to the event. \n

DESCRIPTION:Join the Dordogne Cambridge Group for their upcoming visit to the Cloisters of Cadouin. \nThis is a break with tradition: dwhen our group began\, most people lived in this part of the Dordogne and had already seen the main places of interest in the area\, so those places were not usually chosen for group outings\, but some conversations last summer made me realise that so many of us live in other parts of the region that many members have never visited the Dordogne sites. \nSo this is a chance to see one of the most beautiful of them all\, which draws people from all over the world. Even if you have been there before\, you will definitely not be bored: the opulence of the carving is incredible. \nA bonus is that our tour will be followed by lunch at much-appreciatedÂ Restaurant de lâ€™Abbaye which is just across the road. \nMore info on this too will follow soon\, so we can make the necessary reservations in good time.

SUMMARY:Oxford and Cambridge Talk : The Menace of Monolinguism
DESCRIPTION:Thurs 28th March – Oxford and Cambridge Talk :Â The Menace of Monolinguism \nIs Monolingualism harming us? Does the study of language benefit the individual and society? Can multilingualism contribute towards our health and well-being\, social cohesion and diplomacy? \nWho better to answer these questions than Wendy Ayers-Bennett\, Professor of French Philology and Linguistics at the University of Cambridge and Professorial Fellow in Linguistics at Murray Edwards College\, Cambridge. \nWendy Ayres-Bennett obtained her BA and MA studying Modern Languages\, French and German\, at Girton College\, Cambridge and has since specialised in the evolution and history of the French language and the history of linguistic thought. She has had six posts as a Visiting Professor in France and is a Principal Investigator on the MEITS project\, Â Multilingualism; Empowering Individuals\, Transforming Societies. Her books include a History of the French Language and Problems and Perspectives; Studies in the Modern French Language. \nThe lecture is taking place atÂ 18 rue BonaparteÂ where we are the guests of the Czech Cultural Centre. This property has close ties to the history of Czechoslovakia\, having been used by a number of Czech organisations\, including the Sokol movement\, and was the base from which Edward Benes\, future President of Czechoslovakia\, with T.G. Masaryk and M.R. Stefanik organised a Czecho-Slovak army to fight for the Western Allies in France. \n

SUMMARY:The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture: Gene Machine
DESCRIPTION:Thurs 7th March 2019 â€“ The Cambridge Cutting Edge Lecture: Â Gene Machine\nThe race for the structure of the ribosome â€” a study in the sociology of science\nEveryone has heard of DNA â€” the molecule that seems to hold the secrets of all life\, but hardly anyone has heard of the ribosome. While DNA is the blueprint for life it rests inertly within our cells. The ribosome is an enormous molecular machine\, even more ancient than DNA that translates the information in our genes into proteins. These proteins in turn make up much of our bodies and catalyse thousands of processes within our cells. \nA ribosome is a machine no cell can do without\, but until recently\, how this machine worked was a mystery. As well as being essential for life\, its practical importance also lies in the fact that the ribosome is the target of many major antibiotics. A knowledge of the structure of the ribosome is the key to the development of new treatments against deadly infections\, so crucial for the future of mankind. \nIn his lecture Venki Ramakrishnan will outline the extraordinary race between groups of scientists around the world to be the first to uncover the structure of this central element of the human body. It is a story of high science\, rivalry\, generosity and mutual support. In other words it is a story of humanity uncovering one of the secrets of humanity! \nHe will also talk about what he calls the Politics of Recognition in science. It is a well-known adage that the essential first step to a Nobel Prize is to work in a lab where there are already Nobel Laureates â€” is this true and\, if so\, what does this mean? There have been 12 Nobel Prizes for staff of his own lab since it opened in 1958\, as well as 11 for scientists who have spent time there as visitors. \nVenki is group leader at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. In 2009 he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on ribosomal structure and was knighted in 2012. He is a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences\, Leopoldina and EMBO\, and a Foreign Member of the Indian National Science Academy. In 2015\, he was elected as President of the Royal Society for a five-year term.
