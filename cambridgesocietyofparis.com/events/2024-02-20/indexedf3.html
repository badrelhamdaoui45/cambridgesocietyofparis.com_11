DESCRIPTION:Event sold out. A waiting list is available for those who are interesting in taking up any tickets that may become available due to cancellations. Please note that waiting list tickets will have to be paid for either by bank transfer or cheque as credit card payment is not available. \nOn Tuesday\, 20th February\, from 19:00 p.m. on\, all members of the Society – as well as our friends from the Oxford University Society in Paris – are cordially invited to an evening at Cave Pétillance\, 19 rue Condorcet\, 75009 Paris. Different wines – accompanied by a small selection of cheese and meats – will be served. Do not miss the chance to sample some interesting wines in a casual setting with fellow Society members. \nTickets\, if they become available\, are €25 per person. You can request to be included on the waiting list by selecting one ticket using the “+” button in the tickets section below. A dropdown question will then ask if you would like to have one or two tickets\, if there are any cancellations.
